# **CPU-Scheduling Algorithms**

### Advantages of CPU-Scheduling Algorithms:

- **Maximum CPU Utilization:** Maintain maximum CPU activity.

- **Maximum Throughput:** Increase the number of processes that complete execution in a unit of time.

- **Minimum Turnaround Time:** Reduce the overall time needed to complete a specific task.

- **Minimum Waiting Time:** Minimize the length of time that a process has been in the ready queue.

- **Minimum Response Time:** Decrease the time elapsed from the moment a request is received until the first response is generated.
